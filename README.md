or [local feed](https://localhost:8080/feed).


## Components

The application quite small and currently has just under 900 LoC currently uses
[HTTP-Kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit) as server instead of
[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring), but there is not really reason
for either choice.

For HTML scraping is done using [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive)
and the XML feeds are produced using
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup).

For logging, [Timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) is used; it's
nice as it doesn't require XML or property files.

The data store can be a SQLite database for testing or PostgreSQL for
production and hosting.
